1. USE AND MODIFICATION OF THE SOFTWARE. 
 
   A) Subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations in this 
      Agreement, Microsoft grants you a non-exclusive, world-wide, 
      royalty-free copyright license to use and modify the Software 
      solely as part of your own web applications which are served at 
      runtime from a web server over the internet to run on a Javascript
      runtime in a remote end user’s web browser (referred to as 
      “Applications”).  You may distribute the Software only to the 
      extent necessary for end users to make use of your Application(s) 
      in their web browsers.  You may not rent, lease or lend any of 
      Your rights in the Software.   

   B) Subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations in this 
      Agreement, Microsoft grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, 
      non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license under 
      only its patents that read directly on the Software as provided to
      you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and/or otherwise 
      dispose of the Software in your Applications, conditioned upon 
      your compliance with the requirements and limitations described in
      Sections 1(A) and 1(C).
  
   C) You must 

      - ensure that the Applications are compatible with the then 
        current Deep Zoom Image (DZI) File Format published by Microsoft
        at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=164944;

      - indicate in the user interface of your Application that your 
        Application is “built on Microsoft technology”; and

      - indemnify, defend and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims,
        including attorneys’ fees, related to the distribution or use of
        Your Applications.

      Additionally, You may not

      - alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in the Software;
 
      - Except as expressly granted in this Agreement, use Microsoft’s 
        trademarks in Your programs’ names or in a way that suggests 
        Your Applications come from or are endorsed by Microsoft;
 
      - include the Software in malicious, deceptive or unlawful 
        Applications; 

      - port the Software to another programming language; or

      - modify or distribute the Software so that any part of it becomes
        subject to an Excluded License.  An Excluded License is one that
        requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution, 
        that

        - the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or 

        - others have the right to modify it.

2. SCOPE OF LICENSES.  The Software is licensed, not sold. This 
   agreement only gives You some rights to use and distribute the 
   Software.  Microsoft reserves all other rights.  Unless applicable 
   law gives You more rights despite this limitation, You may use and 
   distribute the Software only as expressly permitted in this 
   agreement.

   LAWS AND REGULATIONS.  YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND

4. SUPPORT.  Microsoft is not obligated to provide any technical or 
   other support (“Support Services”) for the Software to You.  However,
   if Microsoft chooses to provide any Support Services to You, Your use
   of such Support Services will be governed by then-current Microsoft 
   policies.  With respect to any technical or other information You 
   provide to Microsoft in connection with the Support Services, You 
   agree that Microsoft has an unrestricted right to use such 
   information for its business purposes, including for product support
   and development.  Microsoft will not use such information in a form 
   that personally identifies You. 

5. TERMINATION.  If You are dissatisfied with any aspect of the Software
   at any time, Your sole and exclusive remedy is to cease using it.  
   You acknowledge that termination and/or monetary damages may not be a
   sufficient remedy if You breach this agreement and that Microsoft 
   will be entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies, to 
   injunctive or equitable relief as may be deemed proper by a court of 
   competent jurisdiction in the event of a breach.  This Section and 
   Sections 2,  6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 will survive termination of this
   agreement, along with any other provisions that would reasonably be 
   deemed to survive such events.

6. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.  Except for the licenses expressly granted 
   under this agreement, Microsoft retains all right, title and interest
   in and to the Software, and all intellectual property rights therein.
   No other rights except those expressly granted in this Agreement 
   shall be deemed granted, waived or received by implication, 
   exhaustion, estoppel, or otherwise.  Without limiting the foregoing, 
   You are not authorized to alter, modify, copy, edit, format, create 
   derivative works of or otherwise use any materials, content or 
   technology provided under this agreement except as explicitly 
   provided in this agreement.  

7. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This agreement is the entire agreement with 
   respect to the Software.

8. APPLICABLE LAW.  

   i. United States. If You acquired the Software in the United States,
      Washington State law governs the interpretation of this agreement 
      and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of 
      laws principles. The laws of the state where You live govern all 
      other claims, including claims under state consumer protection 
      laws, unfair competition laws and in tort.

  ii. Outside the United States. If You acquired the Software in any 
      other country, the laws of that country apply.

9. LEGAL EFFECT.  This agreement describes certain legal rights.  You 
   may have other rights under the laws of Your country.  This agreement
   does not change Your rights under the laws of Your country if the 
   laws of Your country do not permit it to do so.

10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.   The Software is licensed “as-is.”  You 
    bear the risk of using it.  Microsoft gives no express or implied 
    warranties, guarantees or conditions.  You may have additional 
    consumer rights under Your local laws which this agreement cannot 
    change.  To the extent permitted under Your local laws, Microsoft 
    excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a 
    particular purpose and non-infringement.  Without limiting the 
    generality of the foregoing, Microsoft makes no warranties regarding
    the  Software, and hereby disclaims all warranties that might 
    otherwise be implied by law.

11. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES.   You can 
    recover from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to 
    U.S. $5.00.  You cannot recover any other damages, including 
    consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental 
    damages.

    This limitation applies to

    - anything related to the Software; and

    - claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or 
      condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the 
      extent permitted by applicable law.

    It applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the 
    possibility of the damages.  The above limitation or exclusion may 
    not apply to You because Your country may not allow the exclusion or
    limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
